# Compiler Construction Course

Every Wednesday and Friday, from 11:00 am to 12:40 pm at room 315.

## Objective

Introduce basic compiler construction concepts.

* Static analysis
* Semantic analysis
* Code generation

## Project

The course project consists on the implementation of _Imπiler_, a compiler from
the Imπ language to Π IR, the intermediate representation language
defined in the [Π
framework](https://github.com/ChristianoBraga/PiFramework/). The
grammar for the Imπ language together with the transformation to Π IR
(aka Π denotations) can be obtained
[here](https://github.com/ChristianoBraga/PiFramework/blob/master/doc/pi-denotations-for-imp.md).  
Each construction of Π IR is specified in terms of the so-called Π
automata. The Π automata semantics for Π IR can be obtained [here](https://github.com/ChristianoBraga/PiFramework/blob/master/doc/pi-in-a-nutshell.md).

This project has the following objectives:
* Introduce basic concepts of compiler construction.
* To exercise the development of a _formally specified_ software.
* To exercise software development with a _declarative_ programming language.
* To use tools for collaborative software development.

The project is organized in 3 modules: (i) Expressions and commands,
(ii) Declarations and (iii) Abstractions. Each module increases the
expressivity of the Imπ language. 

Each group will have at most 3 members. Once they are formed, a
programming language will be assigned to each group. For every module,
a repository must be added to the associated assignment in the
course's [class room](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/).
